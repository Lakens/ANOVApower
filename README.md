The alpha version of ANOVApower has been transformed into Superpower
together with Aaron Caldwell. The new GitHub repository is at:
<https://github.com/arcaldwell49/Superpower>. An extensive manual for
Superpower can be found at: <https://aaroncaldwell.us/SuperpowerBook/>.
ANOVApower will not be updated. All future development will happen at
the SUperpower site.

The manuscript introducing Superpower can now be found at:
