\title{Using the formulas below, we can calculate the means for between designs with one factor (One-Way ANOVA). Using the formula also used in Albers & Lakens (2018), we can determine the means that should yield a specified effect sizes (expressed in Cohen's f).}
\usage{
mu_from_ES(K, ES)
}
\arguments{
\item{K}{Number of groups (2, 3, or 4)}

\item{ES}{Effect size (eta-squared)}
}
\value{
Returns plots with power curves for the effects, and a dataframe with the summary data.
