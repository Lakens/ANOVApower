## Set up a within design with 2 factors, each with 2 levels,
## with correlation between observations of 0.8,
## 40 participants (woh do all conditions), and standard deviation of 2
## with a mean pattern of 1, 0, 1, 0, conditions labeled 'condition' and
## 'voice', with names for levels of "cheerful", "sad", amd "human", "robot"
design_result <- ANOVA_design(string = "3b", n = 40, mu = c(1, 0, 1),
      sd = 2, labelnames = c("condition", "cheerful", "neutral", "sad"))
power_result <- power_oneway_between(design_result, alpha_level = 0.05)
